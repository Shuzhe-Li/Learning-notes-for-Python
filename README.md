# Learning-notes-for-Python
I am student major in automation. 
I have been learning C/C++\Matlab and have had some basement about Programming. 
As I known, Python is a so great computer language that every student interested in IT should learn it. 
It is the first time I learning Python, so I will record some notes about my questions and thinking when I learn.
